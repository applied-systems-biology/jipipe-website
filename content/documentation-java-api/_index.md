This section is about the ACAQ Java API that allows you to create [SciJava](https://scijava.org)
plugins to extend JIPipe. The Java API is very powerful and allows you to add algorithms, annotation types and new data types. It also allows you to create UI-only components such as parameter editors, plots, and table processing operations.

You can refer to the JIPipe JavaDocs for more information about the API specifics.
The following tutorials will show you to implement your own Java extensions via
small examples.
