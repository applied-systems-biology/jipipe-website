The graph editor (pipeline editor) allows you to edit the processing steps of a [graph compartment](/documentation/graph-compartment).
Its user interface is separated into three sections:

1. **The analysis graph** contains the processing steps (also referred as algorithms)
2. **The settings panel** shows the properties of the currently selected algorithms
3. **The toolbar** allows you to add more algorithms into the graph, navigate to existing algorithms, change some behavior settings of the graph editor, and create screenshots

# Analysis graph

The analysis graph contains *algorithms* that are represented by rectangles. The algorithm graph area will automatically grow depending on where you place the algorithms.
Scroll bars will appear if the graph area is larger than the available screen size.

{{% notice tip %}}
An alternative to using the scroll bars is to hold the middle mouse button while dragging the your mouse.

Algorithms read data from their **input slots** and output the results into the **output slots**.
There are some algorithms that do not have input slots - they produce output based on their current *parameters*. The algorithm user interface has three sections:

1. **Input slots** are located on the top of the algorithm UI. Each slot has a unique name that is displayed below the arrow. The arrow opens a menu that allows you to make/modify connections or change other options specific to the slot. Depending on the algorithm, a `+` button is created that allows you to add more slots.
2. **The drag area** allows you to move the algorithm around. Move your {{< icon name="fa-mouse-pointer" size="medium" >}} mouse pointer over the area and drag your mouse while holding the ðŸ–± left mouse button. On clicking the {{< icon name="fa-wrench" size="medium" >}} button, a menu will open that contains some algorithm options. Alternatively you can right-click the drag area to open this menu.
3. **Output slots** are located on the bottom and allow you to connect your output data to the input of another algorithm.

{{% notice info %}}
Any output data is always saved automatically by JIPipe. After generating the final output data, there is no need to connect it to any input.

## Slot connections

You can connect two slots by clicking the {{< icon name="fa-chevron-up" size="medium" >}} or {{< icon name="fa-chevron-down" size="medium" >}} button of a slot
and by selecting the source/target slot. Input slots can only receive one connection, while outputs can be distributed to as many inputs as you wish.
The selection menu shows all available target slots and its sorted from the nearest to the slot that is furthest away.

<p><video src="/img/documentation/algorithm-graph-connect.webm" controls autoplay loop/></p>

A connection is shows as line between the connected slots. The color of the line indicates if this connection is valid or invalid depending on
the data types of the source and target.

* A **black** line indicates that the data types match exactly.
* A <span style="color: blue;"><strong>blue</strong></span> line indicates that the types dont match exactly, but can be converted by JIPipe
* A <span style="color: red;"><strong>red</strong></span> line indicates that the types are incompatible. You will probably get an error message during the calculation.

{{% notice tip %}}
Hover with your mouse over a slot's name to show information about its data type.

## Slot options

The slot context menu opened by {{< icon name="fa-chevron-up" size="medium" >}} or {{< icon name="fa-chevron-down" size="medium" >}} contain
additional entries to managing connections.

* {{< icon name="fa-tag" size="medium" >}} **Label this slot** allows you to give the slot a custom name without changing the internal workings of the algorithm (As many algorithms are designed to adress specific slots). On selecting the entry, you can give a custom name that is displayed in *cursive*. To remove the custom label, label it with an empty text.
* {{< icon name="fa-search" size="medium" >}} **Find matching algorithm ...** (only output slots) opens a tool that lists all compatible algorithms that can receive the output data as input.
* Depending on the algorithm, you can remove a slot from within this menu

# Algorithm settings

The algorithm settings are displayed on the right-hand side and contain all settings of the selected algorithm.
There are usually four categories:

* {{< icon name="fa-cog" size="medium" >}} **Parameters** contains general parameters, like the name displayed in the drag area, and algorithm-specific parameters like thresholds, the selection of methods, and other parameters.
* {{< icon name="fa-database" size="medium" >}} **Slots** is an alternative to modifying slots via the algorithm UI. Here, you can also re-order slots.
* {{< icon name="fa-tag" size="medium" >}} **Annotations** is an alternative to modifying slot annotations via the algorithm UI. See above for more info about annotations.
* {{< icon name="fa-play" size="medium" >}} **Quick run** is a tool to run the analysis only up to the selected algorithm. It allows you to try and compare multiple parameters without creating new nodes. See the [testbench documentation](/documentation/testbench) for more info.

# Toolbar

The toolbar contains functions to add new algorithms into the graph, navigate to existing algorithms or search the list of available algorithms, and functions to control the algorithm graph display.

![Toolbar UI](/img/documentation/graph-editor-ui-toolbar.png)

* On the left-hand side you can find a menu containing all **available algorithms**. On selecting an entry, the corresponding algorithm is added to the graph.
* The **navigator** allows you to quickly navigate to an existing algorithm instance or create a new one. Just type one or multiple search terms into the field. On pressing the {{< icon name="fa-keyboard-o" size="medium" >}} *arrow down* key on your keyboard, the first entry is selected.
* The **view options** control how the graph editor behaves and contains some additional utility functions.

## View options

* <img class="inline-image" src="/img/icons/view-horizontal.png" /> and <img class="inline-image" src="/img/icons/view-vertical.png"/> allow you to switch between horizontal and vertial view modes. This does not change the pipeline, but just how it is displayed in the editor. By default, a vertical view is enabled. If you prefer that data flows from left to right, choose the horizontal view mode.
* <img class="inline-image" src="/img/icons/auto-layout-all.png" /> automatically aligns all nodes in the algorithm graph according to the algorithm by Sugiyama *et. al*
* <img class="inline-image" src="/img/icons/cursor-arrow.png" /> allows you to change how dragging the middle mouse button changes the current view.
* <img class="inline-image" src="/img/icons/auto-layout-connections.png" /> is enabled by default and makes it that nodes are automatically aligned on creating connections. This feature does not reorganize the whole graph, but only places the target algorithm to a location that better represents the data flow.
* <img class="inline-image" src="/img/icons/view-restore.png" /> crops the graph area to the area taken by the algorithm nodes. Use this tool to find your nodes after scrolling too far away.
* <img class="inline-image" src="/img/icons/filetype-image.png" /> creates a screenshot of the whole graph compartment that is currently being displayed.
