The ACAQ5 user interface is designed around managing an *analysis project*.
A project contains all information to run an analysis, outside of the input data and
can be saved into [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) files.
The user interface is separated into three sections:

1. **The project menu** contains all operations for the current project / window. It allows you to open/save projects, access and modify [graph compartments](/documentation/graph-compartments), manage [plugins](/documentation/plugins), and run the analysis
2. **The tab bar** allows you to switch between different interfaces associated to the current project. You can close thabs by clicking the `x` icon. If a tab contains some data that will be lost after closing it, you will have to confirm the action. If no question is asked on closing a tab, you will be able to open it later again without losing data.
3. **The current content** depends on the selected tab
