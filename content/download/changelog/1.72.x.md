# Version 1.72.0

* This is the first public release of JIPipe

# Version 1.72.x

* Mostly changes to make JIPipe compatible to SciJava Maven and cleanup
* {{< text-icon new >}} Node “Reduce & split hyperstack” (allows the slicing of Hyperstacks by indices; a more simple alternative to “Reduce & split hyperstack (Expression)”)
* {{< text-icon new >}} Node “Draw/modify ROIs” (interactive editing of ROI; it works but is currently incomplete and subject to change)
