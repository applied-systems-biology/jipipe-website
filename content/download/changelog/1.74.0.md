# Plugin manager

In older JIPipe versions, all extensions are automatically loaded during the JIPipe startup. This was changed to reduce the number of dependencies by letting the users decide which extensions should be loaded (excluding core extensions that are mandatory).

* **New installations will come with the following extensions enabled:** Annotations, Filesystem, Forms, ImageJ algorithms, ImageJ integration, Plots, Python, R, Strings, Table operations, Tools, Utils, ImageJ2 integration, Multi-parameter algorithms
* **Existing installations will enable the following extensions:** Annotations, Filesystem, Forms, ImageJ algorithms, ImageJ integration, Plots, Python, R, Strings, Table operations, Tools, Utils, ImageJ2 integration, Multi-parameter algorithms, Cellpose, CLIJ2 integration, Multi-Template matching, Weka, OMERO

# Environment EasyInstaller

In older JIPipe versions, external environments (Python, Cellpose, R, ...) can be installed via prepackaged installation scripts that replicate the installation procedure that would be applied by a user. We were made aware of issues that are caused by updated to the software or differences in the system configuration.
To simplify the installation of various environments, JIPipe now provides ready-to-used installation packages that can be simply downloaded and extracted via a user-friendly interface termed "EasyInstaller".

Following EasyInstaller packages are available:

* Cellpose 2.x (Windows, Linux, macOS) CPU/GPU 
* Omnipose (Windows, Linux, macOS) CPU/GPU
* Python with skimage, pandas, ... (Windows, Linux, macOS)
* R (Windows)

# TrackMate integration

{{% notice info %}}
The TrackMate integration needs to be activated via the extensions manager. Go to "Plugins > Manage JIPipe plugins" and activate the TrackMate extension.
{{% /notice %}}

# Coloc2 integration

# Cellpose integration

The Cellpose integration was rewritten to make use of the improved Cellpose CLI.

* {{< text-icon improved >}} New nodes designed for Cellpose 2.x
* {{< text-icon deprecated >}} Old Cellpose nodes will still work but are deprecated
* {{< text-icon new >}} Cellpose EasyInstaller that provides prepacked versions of Cellpose 

# Omnipose integration

{{% notice info %}}
The Omnipose integration needs to be activated via the extensions manager. Go to "Plugins > Manage JIPipe plugins" and activate the Omnipose extension.
{{% /notice %}}

Based on the improved Cellpose integration, Omnipose was integrated using dedicated nodes. Please note that Omnipose is based on Cellpose 1.x and requires a dedicated environment.

# Node examples

In previous JIPipe versions, various nodes included a "Load example" button that allowed users to learn about how to utilize the node. An issue with this functionality is that it cannot be easily discovered by users, e.g., via the search box. Additionally, examples cannot be created and distributed by users due to the reliance on Java code. The new version of JIPipe introduces a standardized node example system that can dynamically load examples from files, JAR resources, and node templates. 

* {{< text-icon new >}} Node examples that can be accessed via the "Examples" tab on selecting a node
* {{< text-icon improved >}} Search box / available nodes were improved to include node examples 
* {{< text-icon new >}} Examples for various existing nodes
* {{< text-icon removed >}} Old examples ("Load example") were migrated to new example API

# User interface

## Parameters

In older JIPipe versions, the help of a parameter was displayed upon hovering the item via the mouse. This lead to issues with usability, as well as a slowdown of the interface due to the involvement of performance-intensive Java functions.
Since this version, the parameter documentation can be opened by clicking the `?` icon next to the entry.

* {{< text-icon improved >}} Parameter help now is displayed by clicking the `?` button
* {{< text-icon improved >}} General node parameters are now separated from node-specific settings
* {{< text-icon improved >}} All list parameter editors were improved
* {{< text-icon improved >}} The "Add parameter" dialog was redesigned
* {{< text-icon improved >}} Custom/dynamic parameters now are added via a dedicated parameter editor dialog
* {{< text-icon improved >}} The parameter reference editor was redesigned

## Graph editor

* {{< text-icon new >}} Double-click compartment inputs to navigate to the associated compartment
* {{< text-icon fixed >}} Overlapping nodes could not always be dragged
* {{< text-icon improved >}} Creating edges is now smarter: if there is only one input/output, it is sufficient to drag a line to the node (before: needed to drag a line to the slot). Dragged edges now "snap" to the last output.
* {{< text-icon fixed >}} Resolved slow redraw on Linux
* {{< text-icon improved >}} Slots can be right-clicked to open the slot menu
* {{< text-icon improved >}} Edges are now displayed with arrow heads
* {{< text-icon new >}} "Isolate" now has a hotkey

## Compartment editor

* {{< text-icon new >}} Compartments now can be "executed" by clicking the play button. This will update the cache / execute a quick-run for the compartment output
* {{< text-icon fixed >}} Pasting compartments did not preserve the locations of the contained nodes
* {{< text-icon improved >}} Compartments now can reference parameters from their nodes

## Cache browser / Results viewer

* {{< text-icon improved >}} The UI was redesigned with a Ribbon and greatly simplified
* {{< text-icon new >}} Annotations of selected data rows can be opened as table

## ImageJ alias menu

To facility the transition from ImageJ, a function was introduced to organize JIPipe functionality into different menu locations (alias).
Various existing JIPipe nodes were organized into a menu "IJ" that follows the structure of the ImageJ menu. For example, `Images > Threshold > Auto Threshold 2D` is also organized into `IJ > Image > Adjust > Auto threshold ...`.

* {{< text-icon new >}} Node menu `IJ` that follows the structure of ImageJ
* {{< text-icon improved >}} Aliases are displayed and searchable via the search box / available nodes search
* {{< text-icon improved >}} Aliases are displayed in the algorithm compendium

## Image viewer

* {{< text-icon improved >}} Increased animation speed for channel/frame/depth slider
* {{< text-icon improved >}} Enhanced ROI rendering via a standardized component based on the "Convert ROI to RGB" node., Users have full control over many aspects of ROI rendering.
* {{< text-icon improved >}} ROI rendering as overlay (as done in ImageJ). This means that ROI renders will not pixelate on zooming into images
* {{< text-icon improved >}} Improved zooming behavior (new formula)

### ROI manager

* {{< text-icon new >}} The UI was redesigned by implementing a Ribbon interface
* {{< text-icon new >}} The ROI manager now can measure the selected ROI
* {{< text-icon new >}} ROI can now be selected via a mouse selection tool ("Pick")

### Measurement tool / mask drawer / ROI drawer

* {{< text-icon new >}} The UI was redesigned by implementing a Ribbon interface

## Plot editor

* {{< text-icon improved >}} The plot editor now saves ZIP files instead of directories (easier to handle)

## Table editor

* {{< text-icon improved >}} The table editor was redesigned with a Ribbon UI

## Dependency management

On loading pipelines with missing dependencies, users are prompted with dialogs to indicate that extensions are missing.

* {{< text-icon new >}} Redesigned "Missing dependencies" dialog that allows to enable the missing extensions directly within the dialog
* {{< text-icon new >}} Users are now informed about missing environments (Cellpose, ...) on loading a project 

## Node templates

* {{< text-icon improved >}} You can now right-click entries in the node template editor

# Data management

{{% notice info %}}
Due to the improved data exporter interface, some parameters were deleted. Please evaluate the parameters of "Export data"/"Export images"/"Export table"
{{% /notice %}}

* {{< text-icon improved >}} Greatly simplified data exporter interface (for example used in "Export data" node): functions for automated name generation were removed and merged into expressions
* {{< text-icon new >}} Exporting data tables to *.zip 
* {{< text-icon new >}} Importing data tables from *.zip 
* {{< text-icon new >}} Tables can now exported to XLSX (table editor/cache browser/...)
* {{< text-icon new >}} ImageJ images now save ROI overlays

# Data API

* {{< text-icon new >}} The standardized output format now saves thumbnails, thus avoiding the loading of data in the result preview window
* {{< text-icon new >}} New API to simplify the handling of streamed storage (ZIP etc.)

# Bugfixes and small improvements
