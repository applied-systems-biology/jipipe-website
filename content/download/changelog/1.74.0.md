# Plugin manager

In older JIPipe versions, all extensions are automatically loaded during the JIPipe startup. This was changed to reduce the number of dependencies by letting the users decide which extensions should be loaded (excluding core extensions that are mandatory).

* **New installations will come with the following extensions enabled:** Annotations, Filesystem, Forms, ImageJ algorithms, ImageJ integration, Plots, Python, R, Strings, Table operations, Tools, Utils, ImageJ2 integration, Multi-parameter algorithms
* **Existing installations will enable the following extensions:** Annotations, Filesystem, Forms, ImageJ algorithms, ImageJ integration, Plots, Python, R, Strings, Table operations, Tools, Utils, ImageJ2 integration, Multi-parameter algorithms, Cellpose, CLIJ2 integration, Multi-Template matching, Weka, OMERO

# Environment EasyInstaller

In older JIPipe versions, external environments (Python, Cellpose, R, ...) can be installed via prepackaged installation scripts that replicate the installation procedure that would be applied by a user. We were made aware of issues that are caused by updated to the software or differences in the system configuration.
To simplify the installation of various environments, JIPipe now provides ready-to-used installation packages that can be simply downloaded and extracted via a user-friendly interface termed "EasyInstaller".

Following EasyInstaller packages are available:

* Cellpose 2.x (Windows, Linux, macOS) CPU/GPU 
* Omnipose (Windows, Linux, macOS) CPU/GPU
* Python with skimage, pandas, ... (Windows, Linux, macOS)
* R (Windows)

## ROI processing

There were various ROI-generating nodes with different feature sets. A new set of nodes was developed that make use of modern JIPipe API features. 
All nodes consume two optional inputs:


1. **ROI**: Connect an existing ROI list to append to it. If left unconnected, a new ROI list is generated
2. **Reference**: Connect an image to position ROI according to the image dimensions. If nothing is connected, the boundaries of the ROI provided by **ROI** is used, otherwise the width and height is assumed to be zero.


* {{< text-icon new >}} Node "Draw oval ROI"
* {{< text-icon new >}} Node "Draw rectangular ROI"
* {{< text-icon new >}} Node "Draw text ROI"
* {{< text-icon deprecated >}} Append rectangular ROI, Define rectangular ROI, Append rectangular ROI (referenced), Define rectangular ROI (referenced)

# Node examples

In previous JIPipe versions, various nodes included a "Load example" button that allowed users to learn about how to utilize the node. An issue with this functionality is that it cannot be easily discovered by users, e.g., via the search box. Additionally, examples cannot be created and distributed by users due to the reliance on Java code. The new version of JIPipe introduces a standardized node example system that can dynamically load examples from files, JAR resources, and node templates. 

* {{< text-icon new >}} Node examples that can be accessed via the "Examples" tab on selecting a node
* {{< text-icon improved >}} Search box / available nodes were improved to include node examples 
* {{< text-icon new >}} Examples for various existing nodes
* {{< text-icon removed >}} Old examples ("Load example") were migrated to new example API

# User interface

## Project management

* {{< text-icon new >}} An online-repository system was implemented that allows to download template projects from the web (if you want to add your own project as downloadable example, file a pull request to https://github.com/applied-systems-biology/JIPipe-Repositories/blob/main/project-templates/project-templates.json)

{{% notice info %}}
By default, JIPipe uses the repository https://raw.githubusercontent.com/applied-systems-biology/JIPipe-Repositories/main/project-templates/project-templates.json. Feel free to configure the repository list within Project > Application settings > General > Projects > Template downloader repositories
{{% /notice %}}

## Parameters

In older JIPipe versions, the help of a parameter was displayed upon hovering the item via the mouse. This lead to issues with usability, as well as a slowdown of the interface due to the involvement of performance-intensive Java functions.
Since this version, the parameter documentation can be opened by clicking the `?` icon next to the entry.

* {{< text-icon improved >}} Parameter help now is displayed by clicking the `?` button
* {{< text-icon improved >}} General node parameters are now separated from node-specific settings
* {{< text-icon improved >}} All list parameter editors were improved
* {{< text-icon improved >}} The "Add parameter" dialog was redesigned
* {{< text-icon improved >}} Custom/dynamic parameters now are added via a dedicated parameter editor dialog

## Graph editor

* {{< text-icon new >}} Double-click compartment inputs to navigate to the associated compartment
* {{< text-icon fixed >}} Overlapping nodes could not always be dragged
* {{< text-icon improved >}} Creating edges is now smarter: if there is only one input/output, it is sufficient to drag a line to the node (before: needed to drag a line to the slot). Dragged edges now "snap" to the last output.
* {{< text-icon fixed >}} Resolved slow redraw on Linux
* {{< text-icon improved >}} Slots can be right-clicked to open the slot menu
* {{< text-icon improved >}} Edges are now displayed with arrow heads

* {{< text-icon new >}} Annotations of selected data rows can be opened as table

![New cache browser UI](/changelog/1.74.0/cache-browser.png)

## ImageJ alias menu

To facility the transition from ImageJ, a function was introduced to organize JIPipe functionality into different menu locations (alias).
Various existing JIPipe nodes were organized into a menu "IJ" that follows the structure of the ImageJ menu. For example, `Images > Threshold > Auto Threshold 2D` is also organized into `IJ > Image > Adjust > Auto threshold ...`.

* {{< text-icon new >}} Node menu `IJ` that follows the structure of ImageJ
* {{< text-icon improved >}} Aliases are displayed and searchable via the search box / available nodes search
* {{< text-icon improved >}} Aliases are displayed in the algorithm compendium

* {{< text-icon improved >}} Enhanced ROI rendering via a standardized component based on the "Convert ROI to RGB" node., Users have full control over many aspects of ROI rendering.
* {{< text-icon improved >}} ROI rendering as overlay (as done in ImageJ). This means that ROI renders will not pixelate on zooming into images
* {{< text-icon improved >}} Improved zooming behavior (new formula)

### ROI manager

* {{< text-icon new >}} The UI was redesigned by implementing a Ribbon interface
* {{< text-icon new >}} The ROI manager now can measure the selected ROI

On loading pipelines with missing dependencies, users are prompted with dialogs to indicate that extensions are missing.

* {{< text-icon new >}} Redesigned "Missing dependencies" dialog that allows to enable the missing extensions directly within the dialog
* {{< text-icon new >}} Users are now informed about missing environments (Cellpose, ...) on loading a project 

## Node templates

* {{< text-icon improved >}} You can now right-click entries in the node template editor

# Data management
