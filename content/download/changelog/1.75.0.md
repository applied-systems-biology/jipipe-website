# 1.75.1

* {{< text-icon fixed >}} Critical bug where enum parameters could not be initialized

# Image processing

Various nodes that generate statistics on labels

* {{< text-icon new >}} Node "Merge 2D slices into hyperstack" (inverse operation of "Split into 2D slices"). Intended for more advanced filtering of hyperstack slices.
* {{< text-icon new >}} Node "Merge small labels" (merges labels with a low number of pixels into a neighboring label index)
* {{< text-icon new >}} Node "Key/Value Histogram 5D"
* {{< text-icon new >}} Node "Key/Value threshold statistics 5D" 
* {{< text-icon new >}} Node "Key/Value statistics 5D (fast averages)"
* {{< text-icon new >}} Node "Key/Value threshold statistics 5D (fast averages)"
* {{< text-icon improved >}} Convolve operators now have normalization parameter
* {{< text-icon improved >}} Convolve operators now support RGB images (same behavior as ImageJ)

# Data processing

* {{< text-icon new >}} Node "Filter by annotation" (more compact version of "Split & filter by annotation" that applies the same operation)

# Expressions

* {{< text-icon new >}} New function `STRING_FORMAT` (C-style string formatting)
* {{< text-icon new >}} New function `NUM` (Alternative to `TO_NUMBER`)
* {{< text-icon improved >}} Expressions that return numbers: valid numeric strings are automatically converted to numbers (before there was an exception if not a `Number` type is returned)
* {{< text-icon fixed >}} Escaping of expressions did not work as expected (errors if sub-strings contained spaces)

# User interface 

* {{< text-icon improved >}} New "Memory" menu in the status bar that contains all memory-related operations (before was only a gear icon)
* {{< text-icon improved >}} "Reduce memory" moved into the "Memory" menu
* {{< text-icon fixed >}} Number editor behaved erratically in non-english locales (now uses the advanced number parser capable of parsing NA and infinity)

# Bugfixes and small improvements

{{% notice info %}}
Please refer to the commits in the JIPipe GitHub repository to find a list of all bugfixes and improvements.
{{% /notice %}}

* {{< text-icon improved >}} Various expression-based nodes now support custom expression variables: Filter labels by statistics, Filter ROI by statistics, Change ROI properties (Expression), Set ROI metadata by statistics (expression), Sort ROI list (expression)
* {{< text-icon fixed >}} Numeric function expression now appropriately sets the `default` variable
* {{< text-icon fixed >}} Crop 2D node: expression variables are now all annotated
* {{< text-icon fixed >}} "Examples" panel now always shown
* {{< text-icon fixed >}} Data processing: empty data batches are removed/ignored (only affects nodes with optional inputs)
* {{< text-icon fixed >}} Various exceptions caused by the "Data batches" panel
* {{< text-icon fixed >}} Image viewer: Movie/sequence export was not adhering to magnification level (cut-off images)
* {{< text-icon fixed >}} Users were able to enable ROI/Mask for "Bright spots segmentation 2D", "Hessian segmentation 2D" and "Internal gradient segmentation 2D". Users are now advised to build a custom set of nodes (documentation was added)

# Known issues
