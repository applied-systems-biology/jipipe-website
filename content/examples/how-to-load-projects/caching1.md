To run a specific node or compartment, click the {{< icon name="fa-play-circle" size="medium" >}} button that is located on the node. Afterwards, select one of the options:

1. `Update cache` will run the pipeline up to the selected node and store only the results of the selected node
2. `Cache intermediate results` will run the pipeline up to the selected node, but *also store all results of all predecessors*

Choose the option that is most convenient for you.
