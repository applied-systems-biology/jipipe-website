{{< notice info >}}
Running a pipeline will store the results to the hard drive. While the generated directory structure can be browsed by humans, it is mainly designed to be opened by the JIPipe result browser.

If you want to re-open a generated results directory, navigate to `Project > Open analysis output`

If you intend to export files in a form that is more suitable for humans, please check out our [tutorials](/tutorials).
