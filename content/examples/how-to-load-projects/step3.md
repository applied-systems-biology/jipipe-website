You will have two options:

1. `This window` will open the project in the current window
2. `New window` will create a new JIPipe window for the project

Choose the option that is most convenient for you.

Afterwards, the project will be opened in the JIPipe editor.

To execute the pipeline, you have two options:

1. [Running the whole pipeline](#step-4): ðŸ‘‰ *this is recommended for running finalized pipelines on the full dataset*
2. [Caching specific nodes or compartments](#step-8): ðŸ‘‰ *use this option if still want to modify the pipeline or want to review intermediate results*
