## Can I open a table in ImageJ instead of JIPipe or vice versa?

Yes, and even more: Depending on the data type there are multiple options on displaying data available.
Select the data in the result view or cache browser and click the `...` button at the bottom.
JIPipe will even remember the last setting for you.

## Can I save data by their metadata?

Yes, use the node `Miscellaneous > Export data`. It will export all incoming data into one or multiple folders and
generates names based on metadata.
