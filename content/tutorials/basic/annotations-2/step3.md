In the `Slots` tab (red arrow 1) we can also change the properties of the already present first output slot.

To do this, select the slot to be edited (red arrow 2). Here the data type can be changed if necessary (red arrow 3) and a new name can be entered (red arrow 4). When done editing, accept the changes (red arrow 5).

You can also modify/delete/re-arrange slots by either clicking the â–¼ located on the node or by right-clicking the slot within the graph editor.
