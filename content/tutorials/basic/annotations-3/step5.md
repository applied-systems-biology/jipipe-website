Let's assume that we need the `ThresholdDiff` annotation in an earlier step (the raw image) or even completely different "branch" of processed data. JIPipe provides a node to copy annotations between two data sets: `Merge annotations`.

Begin by adding `Merge annotations` into the graph and navigate to the `Examples` tab. Here, load the example `Merge annotations (2 inputs)` for convenience. Alternatively, you can create the inputs yourself.
