Another `Import/Export` option (red arrow 1) is saving a ZIP file (red arrow 2) of the entire dataset (red arrow 3).

{{< notice info >}}
The generated ZIP file (or directory if the other option is chosen) will contain the displayed table, including its metadata and data in a standardized JIPipe format. 

While the format can be browsed by humans, it is mainly designed for reading via a program. The export of data into a format more suitable for humans will be handled in a later tutorial.
