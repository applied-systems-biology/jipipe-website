Add the `Comment` node to the GUI (red arrow 1). Link the node to the Folder list node (red arrow 2) (or to any node). 

The `Comment` node does not execute any command, only stores additional information. The information can be text or image(s). We copy the text from the ImageJ info box into the node using the Description field (red arrow 3), using the text (red line 4) and the RGB-converted image from the image viewer of the `Import image` node (red arrow 5). The image can be added via the `Image` tab (red arrow 6), using e.g., the clipboard content (red arrow 7). 

Here we used the image viewer export function, after having converted the image into RGB, as described in [another tutorial](/tutorials/ui/image-viewer-1/#step-7).
