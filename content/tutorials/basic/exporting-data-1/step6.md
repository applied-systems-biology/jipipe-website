A benefit of the machine-readable JIPipe format is that all contained data and metadata can be conveniently restored by JIPipe.

Open the [Tutorial_B22-1_Part1.jip](/tutorials/b22-1/Tutorial_B22-1.zip) project that comes pre-loaded with nodes that cover various import scenarios:

The node `Import data table (archive)` (red rectangle 1) can import a ZIP file generated by the cache browsers' ZIP-exporter function.

If the data is stored inside a directory (or if you just extract the ZIP), use the `Import data table (directory)` node (red rectangle 2 and 3).
In the example pipeline, we import both the `All outputs` export generated by the cache browser, and the `AVG-Density` output that was exported via the node.

{{< notice tip >}}
You can easily identify valid ZIP files or directories for the import by checking whether a `data-table.json` file is located directly within the directory or ZIP file.
