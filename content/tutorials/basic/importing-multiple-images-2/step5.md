The file names also need to be annotated. Here we will use a simpler approach via the Add path to annotations node (red arrow 1); add this node via any of the ways we have seen before. Rename the Generated annotations field to Filename, to make it more specific (the default name of Dataset, which is very general). The “#” before the name indicates that this annotation is of primary importance, e.g., the results will be grouped based on annotations that are marked with “#” as especially important.
