The image contrast can be selected from a list (red arrow 1), using `Auto` (red arrow 2) is the default setting. The multichannel image can be converted into an RGB image (red arrow 3), whereas the zoom factor can be set via a +/- button set (red arrow 4). The resulting image can be exported or copied into the system cache as described before (red arrow 5).

{{< notice info >}}
Basic information about the image (resolution, bit depth, etc.) can be found in the toolbar of the image viewer and within the "String representation" column in the cache browser.
