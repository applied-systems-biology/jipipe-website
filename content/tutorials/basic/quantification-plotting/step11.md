It is always good practice to output the final results of a compartment into the compartment output.

Add a new input slot to the compartment output node for the ROI list (red arrow 1) by searching for `roi` (red arrow 2) and selecting the `ROI list` data type (red arrow 3). 

Name the new slot (red arrow 4) and add it to the node (red arrow 5).
