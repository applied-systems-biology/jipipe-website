You can freely connect `Comment` nodes to the inputs or outputs of other nodes (red box 1).

ðŸ‘‰ Comments are automatically excluded from pipeline runs, as they do not contain any workloads. You can freely connect them to anywhere you like *without changing the behaviour of the pipeline.*

{{< notice tip >}}
Bookmark comments with tasks or other instructions, so that students can find them easily via the `Bookmarks` panel.

Bookmarks also render the description, so you can also use comments to ask for answers, e.g.,:

> `Name` *Run the pipeline and find out how many objects were detected*
> `Description` Your answer (How many objects?): [insert your answer here]
