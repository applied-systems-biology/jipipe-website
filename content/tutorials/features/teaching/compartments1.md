In many lectures it is common to teach that image analysis tasks can be divided into a steps, for example `Preprocessing`, `Analysis`, and `Postprocessing`.

JIPipe facilitates this concept by its graph compartment feature that can be accessed via the `Compartments` tab (red arrow 1). The compartment function separates the pipeline into units that can be connected to each other to enforce a specific order of operations (red arrow 2).
