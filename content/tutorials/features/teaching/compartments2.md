By double-clicking a compartment in the `Compartments` tab, it is opened in a pipeline editor tab (red arrow 1).

Compartments communicate to each other via interface nodes: each compartment has a dedicated *output node* that determines the outputs of the current compartment (red arrow 2).

ðŸ‘‰ When creating exercises, use this feature to define the outputs of each specific compartment. This can help students who need guidance on what kind of data should be produced in each image analysis step.
