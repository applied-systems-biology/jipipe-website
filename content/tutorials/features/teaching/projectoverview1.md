Each JIPipe project comes with a customizable `Project overview` tab that can be accessed via the `Help > Project overview` menu (red box 1).

It contains the following elements:

1. A customizable title with authors, website, contact info and more (red box 2)
2. A customizable rich text description with text and images (red box 3) 
3. Quick access to bookmarked nodes and selected parameters (both fully customizable; red box 4)

ðŸ‘‰ Save the project while the `Project overview` is open. JIPipe will then show the tab when a student opens the project. Alternatively, you can enforce via the project settings that the overview should be always opened first.
