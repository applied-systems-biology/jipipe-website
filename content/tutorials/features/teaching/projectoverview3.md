Bookmarks are *not* edited within the `Project settings` tab, but by marking a node directly as bookmarked.

To do this, select your node of interest (red arrow 1) and check the `Bookmark this node` parameter within the `Parameters` tab.

ðŸ‘‰ Bookmarked nodes are highlighted by a green shadow

ðŸ‘‰ Bookmarked nodes automatically appear within the `Bookmarks` panel of the `Project overview`, as well as in a second `Bookmarks` tab that appears if no node is selected
