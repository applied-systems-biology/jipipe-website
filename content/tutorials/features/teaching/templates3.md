Groups by themselves are a an excellent mode of reducing the complexity of various operations. To still provide users of the group with means to customize the behaviour of the nodes contained within the group, `Group` nodes support the referencing/export of group-internal parameters (red box 1) to the group itself (red arrow 2).

ðŸ‘‰ For example, teachers can provide a group responsible for segmenting and filtering objects with settings where students can input custom object size constraints:

> `Task`: Glomeruli have a radius of `15 Âµm` to `65 Âµm`. Please setup the `Glomeruli segmentation` area and circularity constraints that only objects with the appropriate size are segmented.
