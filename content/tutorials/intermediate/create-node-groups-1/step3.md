The group dialogue window (red arrow 1) will allow to choose between keeping the original nodes (red arrow 2) or not; for now, we will keep the original nodes, so as to be able to compare the outcome of the group with that of the original node array. 

Another reason to keep the original nodes is that the nodes inside a group DO NOT provide a cache, thus we canâ€™t check the outcome of the individual nodes inside a group.
