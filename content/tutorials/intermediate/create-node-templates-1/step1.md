Nodes with a specific set of parameters, or nodes that are formed into a `Group` (see previous tutorial) can be saved as Templates, in order to make them available for easy reuse. The template nodes can be made accessible either globally (i.e., by other projects as well), or locally, where only the current project can have access to them.
