To observe the newly created template node, click anywhere within the white area of the GUI (red arrow 1), select the `Node templates` tab on the right side (red arrow 2), and scroll down to find the newly added template (red arrow 3). 

Note that the title of the node template (red arrow 4) and the detailed description (red arrow 5) also appear in the summary, together with the slots layout of the node (red line 6). This complete set of information helps to decide which template(s) to use in our projects.
